# BWR Reactor Simulator

Welcome to the BWR Reactor Simulator, a text-based simulation tool for exploring the behavior of a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) under various conditions and fuel types.

## Overview

The BWR Reactor Simulator allows you to interact with a simplified simulation of a BWR reactor. You can change the fuel type, adjust the fuel load, and simulate the reactor's behavior over time.

## Features

- Change the fuel load and fuel type to explore different reactor scenarios.
- Simulate the behavior of the reactor components over time.
- View the status of the reactor, including temperature, xenon levels, neutron population, neutron density, flow rate, and micro Sv rate.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
3. Run the compiled executable to launch the simulator.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the simulator.

## Commands

- `changeFuel`: Change the fuel load and type of the reactor.
- `simulate`: Simulate the behavior of the reactor for a time step.
- `status`: View the current status of the reactor and its components.
- `exit`: Exit the simulator.

## Customization

You are welcome to modify and adapt this simulator for your needs. If you create derivative works or modifications, please adhere to the terms of the PQAR Open-Source License, included in the repository.
